so it doesn't represent a correct Langium model according to its grammar. Please fix this model and return ONLY a correct one for the current request:
Apply the following change 
 "Add events and commands definitions to the first model.
" 
 to the current model 
 "statemachine ManufacturingRobot
initialState idle
state idle
    actions { stopWashing }
end
state washing
    actions { startWashing }
end
state errorState
    actions { handleError }
end
state paused
    actions { pauseWashing }

 and give me back the updated model directly in Langium textual syntax without any markdown formatting, backticks, or other annotations.
